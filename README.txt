A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/tdbunting91/pen/vGGxYa.

 This is my submission for the assignment on FreeCodeCamp titled "Build a tribute page". This is a single page tribute to one of my favorite film composers Hans Zimmer. 

The page is built completely in HTML and CSS with very small bits of Javascript, and utilizes a custom implementation of the Bootstrap framework titled "Paper"based on Google's Material Design spec, which can be found here: http://bootswatch.com/paper/ .
